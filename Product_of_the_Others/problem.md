# ðŸ§® Product of the Others: A No-Division Challenge

## Introduction

Welcome to the **Product of the Others** challenge! This isn't just about multiplying numbersâ€”it's about thinking creatively to solve a common problem with a clever twist. Your goal is to produce an array of products, but with a surprising constraint: **no division allowed!** This exercise will push you to think beyond the obvious and craft an efficient, elegant solution.

## The Problem

You'll be given an array of integers. Your mission is to create a new array where each element at index `i` is the product of all the numbers in the original array, *except* the number at `i`.

For example, if your input is `[a, b, c, d]`, your output should be `[b*c*d, a*c*d, a*b*d, a*b*c]`.

This seems straightforward, but remember the golden rule: **you cannot use the division operator (`/`)!**

### Example in Action

Let's walk through a concrete example to make it crystal clear.

**Input Array:**

```
[1, 2, 3, 4]
```

**Desired Output:**


Your goal is to produce an output array that looks like this:

```
[24, 12, 8, 6]
```

**Breakdown:**
- **Index 0:** The product of the other numbers is `2 * 3 * 4 = 24`.
- **Index 1:** The product of the other numbers is `1 * 3 * 4 = 12`.
- **Index 2:** The product of the other numbers is `1 * 2 * 4 = 8`.
- **Index 3:** The product of the other numbers is `1 * 2 * 3 = 6`.

## Step-by-Step Breakdown

So, how do we solve this without division? The key is to break the problem down into two passes. We can calculate the products of the numbers to the "left" of each element and the products of the numbers to the "right" of each element, then combine them.

### Step 1: Calculate Left Products

First, iterate through the array from left to right. At each index `i`, we'll calculate the product of all elements to its left. We'll store these in a temporary array.

Let's use our example `[1, 2, 3, 4]`:
- `left_products[0]` will be 1 (there's nothing to the left).
- `left_products[1]` will be `1`.
- `left_products[2]` will be `1 * 2 = 2`.
- `left_products[3]` will be `1 * 2 * 3 = 6`.

Our `left_products` array is now `[1, 1, 2, 6]`.

### Step 2: Calculate Right Products

Next, we iterate through the array from right to left. We'll keep track of the product of all elements to the right and update our final result array.

Continuing with our example:
- **`i = 3`**: The product to the right is 1 (nothing to the right). Our final result for this index is `left_products[3] * 1 = 6 * 1 = 6`.
- **`i = 2`**: The product to the right is `4`. Our final result is `left_products[2] * 4 = 2 * 4 = 8`.
- **`i = 1`**: The product to the right is `4 * 3 = 12`. Our final result is `left_products[1] * 12 = 1 * 12 = 12`.
- **`i = 0`**: The product to the right is `4 * 3 * 2 = 24`. Our final result is `left_products[0] * 24 = 1 * 24 = 24`.

### Step 3: Combine and Finalize

By the end of the second pass, our result array will contain the correct products, and we've done it all without a single division!

## Rules & Constraints

- **No Division Allowed:** This is the primary constraint. You must find a solution that does not use the `/` operator.
- **Input Array Size:** The input array will always contain at least two integers.
- **Data Type:** All elements in the input array will be integers.
- **Number Range:** The numbers can be positive, negative, or even zero. Be mindful of how a zero in the input might affect your logic!
